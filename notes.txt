functions: reset game and clear/draw grid

main game loop is just: wait for key 1-9 representing squares, update game state, check if win

somewhere should indicate the current moving player
also some indicator for win?
maybe just keeping a total score would be fine, and incrementing that at a win (we can use the decimal conversion thingy!!!)


use zero padding to make the code look nicer maybe

sprites:
X, O, single square, 7x1 vertical, 1x7 horizontal

parts of the code:
draw grid
draw X and O at bottom or right for score
check if game is won
reset board by looking at game state and drawing the necessary X's and O's again

functions:
draw X score
draw O score
draw thing (X or O, whatever's at I) at the given grid square (0-8)

8C - switch curr. moving indicators
A8 - draw move on grid

registers:
0 - current moving player (1 or 2 -> X or O)
1 - x coord of top left corner of grid
2 - y coord of top left corner of grid
3 - x coord of top left corner of X score
4 - y coord of top left corner of X score
5 - x coord of top left corner of O score
6 - y coord of top left corner of O score
7 - X score
8 - Y score
9 - who won (0, 1, 2)
A - key input
B-E - gen.purpose registers
